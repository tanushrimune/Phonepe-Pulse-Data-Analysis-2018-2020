I recently completed an in-depth analysis of the PhonePe Pulse data from 2018 to 2020. This project allowed me 
to explore the transactional trends and user registrations across various regions and states in India. Here's a brief overview 
of what I've accomplished:

ðŸ”¹ Dashboard 1: Transaction Analysis by Year, Region, and State
1.Total Transaction Amount by Year: Tracked the growth and trends in transaction amounts over the three-year period.
2.Regional Insights: Analyzed transaction volumes across different regions, highlighting the highest and lowest performing regions.
3.State-wise Breakdown: Delved into state-specific data to uncover transaction behaviors and patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Dashboard 2: Top Performing Districts by State
1.Top 5 Districts by Total Transactions: Identified the leading districts in terms of transaction volumes within each state.
2.Registered Users in Top 5 Districts: Highlighted the districts with the highest number of registered users, showcasing 
user adoption and engagement.
3.Top Performing District: Spotlighted the district with the best overall performance, combining transaction volumes and
user registrations.
4.This project was a great opportunity to utilize Power BIâ€™s powerful data visualization capabilities to turn raw data 
into meaningful insights. The dashboards provide a clear and comprehensive view of PhonePe's transactional ecosystem, 
helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
